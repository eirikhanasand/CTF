1. Find the specs for the drone. Max speed: 16ms.
2. Using the time between the clips we can find that it has max traveled 8956 meters.
3. Using this we can draw a circle on a map and locate an area of about 18km diameter.
4. We need to look at the image. What we see are many tall shadows. Such shadows are likely to be masts.
5. Using openinfrastructure.org we can find a map of all telecom masts.
6. We find a lot of masts in the image (a lot of shadows), so we need to look for a lot of masts in the same place on the map.
7. Using the radius and map together we find that there is only one match, around location 58.8107996, 5.6723438.
8. On openinframap we find that "Rogaland Radio" is associated with these masts.
9. Therefore julectf2022{Rogaland Radio} will be the flag.
