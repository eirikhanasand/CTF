1. Change file type from ipa to zip.
2. Decompress zip.
3. Open Payload folder and enter the Login.app package.
4. Enter the assets/assets folder.
5. Open the file valuableAsset.png,
6. The flag is displayed as S2G{5d6fa5762972e69ecc46c6a40dad5057}.

This challenge aims to replicate a common way to search through app code for secret information, or assets that have not yet been taken into use in the code itself. Many big app development companies have suffered from this, as the png files are often in the code beforehand due to development and testing of the feature involving it.
